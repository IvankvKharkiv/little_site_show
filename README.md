# little_site_show
This is just a simple page that was built to demonstrate my basic knowlege of HTML CSS JS.
It was built within two days term to meet the deadlines when vacancy offer is still relevant.
In nearest future building bigger project with backend and SQL logic is in plan.
Due to luck of time nothing better then Calculator came on my mind to demonstrate JS logic. I know it's lame;)
